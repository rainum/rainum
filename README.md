## Education/Work

I'm currently a senior software engineer at [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io), remote-first startup. I spent most part of my time on solving complex issues and mentoring. I live in the Ukraine. I've got a master's degree in computer science.

## Technologies

I'm focused on JavaScript, TypeScript and React. I'm interested in building and designing APIs, solving architecture issues and functional programming. I specialize in messaging architectures, async/concurrent backends, and REST APIs.

## Lifestyle

I keep myself busy by doing things that give me experience, skills, or good stories to tell. I want to spend my life learning and teaching.
